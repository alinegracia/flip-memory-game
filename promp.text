Okay, that is really great. We already build the intro of the game. Now, we will make the flip card game.
When the start button get click, the game will start.
There are 12 pairs of cards, and we will flip it, and match the cards. The card has 2 side, backside and frontside. The back side of the card should the color blue, the frontside of the card is the image that i've already prepare.
I've already have 12 images. the name of this file is "img-1.jpg" - "img-12.jpg".
When we play the game, all the cards show its backside. When we click the card, the card will flip and show the image. If we already flip 2 cards, if it match, it will not flip back. If the cards don't match, the cards will be flip to the backside.

The game should be in the center of the screen(vertical and horizontal)
